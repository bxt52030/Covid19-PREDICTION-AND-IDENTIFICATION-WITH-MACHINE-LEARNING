Title: 
Covid19-PREDICTION-AND-IDENTIFICATION-WITH-MACHINE-LEARNING

Tool Used:
Google Colab-Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing access free of charge to computing resources including GPUs.

Technology Used:
Logistic Regression Algorithm

Objective:
The objective of Covid19 disease identification with machine learning is to detect the Covid19 disease in the early stage itself with the available attributes. 
It will be helpful for the human to detect disease at early stage and to take necessary treatments in the correct time to save life.

Execution Process:
In the first step, we need to go to the google colabs in the google chrome, open the google colabs and it will create a colab Notebooks in our Google drive. 
Inside the colab Notebooks, we will create a folder for covid19 and all the required files  which is CovidCaseDetails_ensemble.csv file, Covid19_prediction1 source code file in same covid19 folder.
Then, we need to open that source file in google colabs and the code will be started executing. Lastly, we need to import all the python, machine learning libraries and then we need to execute all the commands step by step without skipping any part of code. Doing so may lead to errors in the prediction of output.



Dataset filename:
CovidCaseDetails_ensemble.csv
